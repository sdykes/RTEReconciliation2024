## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## 

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{mermaid}

config:
      theme: redux

flowchart TD

%%Nodes
        A[("Orchard information from SNAPGrow")]
        B[("Te Ipu packout information from ABC")]
        C[("Run data from Sunfruit SNAPPack")]
        D@{shape: subproc, label: "Machine learning model, trained on Te Ipu packout data"}
        
%%Edges

A --> D
B --> D
C --> D

```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
